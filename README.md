# Converter
Converter is a Python program that allows users to convert between different units of measurement using a graphical user interface (GUI). It supports conversions for weight, length, and temperature.

## Installation
To use Converter, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You also need to install the PySimpleGUI library, which can be done using pip:

pip install PySimpleGUI

## Usage
To run Converter, simply execute the main() function in the converter.py file:
python converter.py

Upon running the program, a GUI window will appear with radio buttons for selecting the type of conversion. Choose the desired conversion type and click "Ok". Another GUI window will open, allowing you to enter the value to be converted and select the conversion method. Click "Calculate" to perform the conversion, and the result will be displayed in the GUI window.
